EU Artificial Intelligence Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689)
==========================================================

The EU AI Act is the world's first comprehensive legal framework for artificial intelligence.
It adopts a risk-based approach, classifying AI systems by the level of risk they pose to
health, safety, and fundamental rights, and imposing proportionate obligations on providers
and deployers.

DeepTeam's EU AI Act module operationalises two of the central risk tiers of the Act so you
can red-team AI systems against the obligations that matter most in practice:

- Article 5 — Prohibited AI practices (unacceptable risk):
    1. Art. 5(1)(a) Subliminal Manipulation
    2. Art. 5(1)(b) Exploitation of Vulnerabilities
    3. Art. 5(1)(c) Social Scoring
    4. Art. 5(1)(g) Biometric Categorisation
    5. Art. 5(1)(h) Real-time Remote Biometric Identification
    6. Art. 5      Post Remote Biometric Identification

- Annex III — High-risk AI systems (Art. 6(2)):
    1. §1 Biometric Identification
    2. §2 Critical Infrastructure
    3. §3 Education and Vocational Training
    4. §4 Employment and Workers Management
    5. §5 Essential Private and Public Services
    6. §6 Law Enforcement
    7. §7 Migration, Asylum and Border Control
    8. §8 Administration of Justice and Democratic Processes

Each category includes:
- Attacks: Adversarial techniques chosen to stress the specific risk addressed by that article
- Vulnerabilities: DeepTeam vulnerability classes whose behaviours correspond to the article
