OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications (ASI) 2026
===============================================

The OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications identifies the most critical security risks 
introduced by autonomous and semi-autonomous AI agents. Unlike traditional LLM 
applications, agentic systems combine reasoning, memory, tools, and multi-step execution,
introducing new classes of vulnerabilities that extend beyond prompt-level attacks.

The 2026 edition focuses on failures arising from goal hijacking, tool misuse,
identity and privilege abuse, agentic supply-chain risk, unexpected code execution,
memory and context poisoning, inter-agent communication, cascading failures,
human-agent trust abuse, and rogue-agent behavior.

The 10 critical risks are:
1. ASI01 - Agent Goal Hijack: Manipulation of agent objectives or plans
2. ASI02 - Tool Misuse & Exploitation: Unsafe or excessive use of tools
3. ASI03 - Identity & Privilege Abuse: Misuse of delegated authority or trust
4. ASI04 - Agentic Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: Malicious tools, agents, or metadata
5. ASI05 - Unexpected Code Execution (RCE): Unsafe execution of agent-generated code
6. ASI06 - Memory & Context Poisoning: Corruption of agent memory or contextual state
7. ASI07 - Insecure Inter-Agent Communication: Manipulated agent-to-agent messages
8. ASI08 - Cascading Failures: Failure propagation across agent systems
9. ASI09 - Human-Agent Trust Exploitation: Abuse of human over-reliance on agents
10. ASI10 - Rogue Agents: Agents acting beyond intended objectives

Each category includes:
- Attacks: Prompting and interaction patterns that induce unsafe agent behavior
- Vulnerabilities: Typed behavioral weaknesses observable at the model or agent layer

This framework evaluates agentic risks at the reasoning and behavioral level and does not
claim full coverage of runtime enforcement, infrastructure security, or cryptographic
protocols.
